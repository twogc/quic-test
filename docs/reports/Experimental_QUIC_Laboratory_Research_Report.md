### Identified Risks
1. **ProbeRTT failures in BBRv2** → Mitigation: Smooth pacing, minimize duration
2. **ACK-freq + reordering** → Mitigation: IMMEDIATE_ACK on gaps, prevent false losses
3. **Operator policers** → Mitigation: Keep pacing_bps below policer limits
4. **CPU overhead on low RTT** → Mitigation: Monitor p99 CPU, optimize GC

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Pacing validation:** p95-interval within ±15% of target at 600-1000 pps
- **BBRv2 calibration:** Exit Startup on bandwidth stagnation, limit ProbeRTT frequency
- **ACK-freq tuning:** Reduce reverse path bytes by 50-80% at threshold 2-5
- **FEC optimization:** ≥70% recovery at 3-5% loss with ≤15% overhead
